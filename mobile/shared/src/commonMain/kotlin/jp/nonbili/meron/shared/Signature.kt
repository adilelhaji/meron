// Signatures are stored as HTML — one app-wide signature in the core `settings`
// table, plus an optional per-account override — and are inserted into the draft
// body when a composer opens, so what the user sees is what goes out.
//
// The mobile composer edits plain text, so a signature reaches it through
// [signaturePlainText]. Rich markup written on desktop survives untouched as
// long as the text is not edited here (see the settings screen).
//
// The thread's quick reply is seeded the same way, matching desktop. It renders
// as a chat bubble, but what it sends is an ordinary mail that its recipient
// reads in an ordinary client, so leaving it unsigned reads as inconsistency
// rather than brevity. Its tracking is simpler — see quickReplySignature.
