/**
 * Write-through wrapper around the platform preference store.
 *
 * Reads are served entirely from the wrapped store, so they stay synchronous and
 * work before the core is loaded — that is the whole reason the cache exists.
 * Writes go to the cache first (so the UI never waits on the core) and are then
 * mirrored into the core `settings` table, which is authoritative.
 *
 * Only keys in the [mobileSettings] registry are mirrored. Everything else —
 * session state, pending OAuth handshakes — stays device-local by design.
 *
 * Wrapping `AppPreferences` rather than changing every `saveApp*` helper means
 * existing call sites keep working unchanged and cannot forget to write through.
